### Contributing
This is an small project that implements ReactJs on Node.js, I learnt ReactJs step by step first and created examples for what I learnt. Then, I created this Todos Web App to have an full implements of ReactJs.                   
Although the project is light weight, the process of learning process is really meaningful for me to have a deep dive into ReactJs for the whole semester.
